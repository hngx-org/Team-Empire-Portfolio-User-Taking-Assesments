what the user sends:

       body: {
            assessment_id:int,
            answer_obj:[
                {
                    question_id:int,
                    answer:str
                },
                                {
                    question_id:int,
                    answer:str
                }
            ]
        }

in the database now

questions already created for an assessment...........

possible answers are options, that are already in the database, with one of them being true....

question{
    questn text
    correct_option
}

this is what i was thinking before
is that, a,b,c,d

Chunks to achieve:
    -create request schema
    -check the answers via loop
    -get the total score

Tables i'm updating:
